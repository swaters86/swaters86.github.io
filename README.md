===================

This is the repo for my personal website which is still a work in progress. 

You can access it from [swaters86.github.io](http://swaters86.github.io/) or [stevenwaters.com](http://stevenwaters.com)

### To Do 


- Make it so ID attributes and values are not genrated for healdine tags (Hexo Issue)

- Make class names better by making them semantic 

- Eitheir remove role attributes from HTML or figure out how to add more and make the current ones more semantic 

- Fix styles for headline tags 

- Reorganize CSS properties in style.css, the order is off according to idiomatic CSS

- Make the responsive design better be decreasing font size in header and adding padding to article body 

- Update CNAME record so the site is accessible from www.stevenwaters.com instead of stevenwaters.com and I need to add some sort of rewrite for this, I guess
