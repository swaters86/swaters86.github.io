NCS-Customer-Portal 
===========

Static templates that I help create for NEWSCYCLE Solutions. The purpose of this project was to create a customer portal for SalesForce 

I was asked to create two different layouts. I also added a script for showing an "Alert" box which is based on the "Get URL Parameters" script: http://www.netlobo.com/url_query_string_javascript.html
