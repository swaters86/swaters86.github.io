Well here's another post about Static Site Generators. Hopefully the next post will be something entierely different since I have a lot to share on here. 

Last month, I gave a talk about Static Site Generators to the Front-End Design Meetup group here in Tampa, Fl. Overall, I'm quite proud of the below presentation that I created for it. <!-- more -->  I used a HTML5 framework called [http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/](Reveal.js "Reveal.js website"). I would recommend checking it out if you're looking for a fun way to create slides.
